# Regex Tutorial

Welcome to the Regex Tutorial! In this tutorial, we will explore a specific regular expression (regex) pattern that allows us to match a combination of a word and digits. We will break down each component of the regex pattern and explain its functionality. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a clear understanding of how to use this regex pattern to search for specific patterns in strings.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will be focusing on a regex pattern that matches a string consisting of a word followed by a space and then a series of digits. The regex pattern is as follows:

\```regex
^([A-Za-z]+)\s(\d+)$
\```

We will discuss each component of the regex pattern and understand how it contributes to the overall matching process.
